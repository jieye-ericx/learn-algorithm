# 爱好
I came into contact with photography when I was a freshman, and I was fascinated by the feeling of capturing the moment of light and shadow. By purchasing the book of landscape photographer Chu Weimin, I had a systematic study of composition and framing and PS.

# 母校
Athough it is not as good as your school in terms of software and hardware, I did not complain about thesurrounding environment and focused on improvimg myself. I hope to enter a larger platform through efforts.

the most valuable change during my undergraduate period was that I learned to walk out of my comfort zone because no one forced me to study at the University. I knew that I could show my competitiveness in studying only by forcing myself.
