# 爱好
I came into contact with photography when I was a freshman, and I was fascinated by the feeling of capturing the moment of light and shadow. By purchasing the book of landscape photographer Chu Weimin, I had a systematic study of composition framing and PS.

# 母校
Athough it is not as good as your school in terms of software and hardware, I did not complain about thesurrounding environment and focused on improvimg myself. I hope to enter a larger platform through efforts.

the most valuable change during my undergraduate period was that I learned to walk out of my comfort zone because no one forced me to study at the University. I knew that I could show my 
competitiveness in studying only by forcing myself.

# 优点
I have a stable personality and high sense oÍ responsibility.

# 缺点
I think my weakness is that I am an obsessive and I will not stop until a job is well done.

A1though I will spend more time and energy than others, I feel that everything is worth it when I see the results of my work. Of course, I hope that I can pay more attention to time management and improve efficiency while pursuing quality.

# 家乡
Yancheng is seated in central coastal area of Jiangsu Province, facing eastward to the Yellow Sea. 
Yancheng was exploited as early as over 2,100 years ago. 

# 家庭
My family is very democratic. In the family, my demands and interests will be fully respected by my parents .I think my curiosity and creativity have a 1ot to do with my family atmosphere.
I would also 1ike to thank my parents ,they keep our family together and harmonious. I will try my best to live up to their expectations.

# 重复

# 感谢
Thank you for your encouragement, i wi1l go further to enrich my knowledge.
# 自我介绍

Good morning, teachers. I’m very glad to be here for this interview.

My name is Li Kuihao. I’m currently majoring in computer science and Technology in Njtech University.

During my college years, I studied hard and got good grades.I not only won the first prize in the Lanqiao Cup provincial competition and the second prize in the national competition, but also a school-level scholarship every year.
In engineering, I got internship opportunities from Tencent and Bytedance, but the pursuit of deeper academic exploration at a young age inspired me to choose the postgraduate entrance examination.
Engaging these contests provides me with a valuable chance to learn through  experience and establish my scientific thinking.

Next, I'd like to introduce my personality and some interests. As you can see, I am an optimistic student and have good abilities as well as a strong sense of responsibility. 
I used to engage in Propaganda Department to take photos for school news. So, I think this experience will help me devote myself to school days better.
I see myself as a relentless problem-solver, and I’m always looking for a new challenge.

At last, I am very interested in my major .I hope the teacher can give me a chance to study further

That’s all for my self-introduction. Thanks for listening.

# 本科毕业打算
If I were lucky enough to be accepted, I would still focus on my studies. I will establish a reasonable knowledge structure, study the basic knowledge of the subject, and understand aspects of the research field. I will also strive to master the methods and skills of independent research. 

# 研究方向
 I think that the choice of research direction not only needs to match with personal intesest, but also have relationship with my tutor ,so I would ask my tutor and reasonably measure my personal level at this stage, so as to choose a research direction.
