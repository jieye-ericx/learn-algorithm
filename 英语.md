# 爱好
I came into contact with photography when I was a freshman, and I was fascinated by the feeling of capturing the moment of light and shadow. By purchasing the book of landscape photographer Chu Weimin, I had a systematic study of composition framing and PS.

# 母校
Athough it is not as good as your school in terms of software and hardware, I did not complain about thesurrounding environment and focused on improvimg myself. I hope to enter a larger platform through efforts.

the most valuable change during my undergraduate period was that I learned to walk out of my comfort zone because no one forced me to study at the University. I knew that I could show my competitiveness in studying only by forcing myself.

# 自我介绍
// Good afternoon, teachers. I’m very glad to be here for this interview and very pleased to meet you.

My name is Li Kuihao. I’m currently majoring in computer science and Technology in Njtech University.

During my college years, I studied hard and got good grades.I not only won the first prize in the Lanqiao Cup provincial competition and the second prize in the national competition, but also a school-level scholarship every year.In engineering, I got internship opportunities from Tencent and Byte, but the pursuit of deeper academic exploration at a young age inspired me to choose the postgraduate entrance examination.
Engaging these contests provides me with a valuable chance to learn through experiment experience and establish my scientific thinking.

Next, I'd like to introduce my personality and some interests. As you can see, I am an optimistic student and have good abilities as well as a strong sense of responsibility. I see myself as a relentless problem-solver, and I’m always looking for a new challenge.

At last, I am very interested in my major and I love my school very much. I used to engage in Propaganda Department to take photos for school news. So, I think this experience will help me devote myself to school days better.

That’s all for my self-introduction. Thanks for listening.
